# TorchStream

TorchStream is a library to help ML developers stream their pytorch models without retraining nor rewriting them. 
Streaming a model that outputs sequential data (audio, video, text, ...) will reduce its latency or even enable it 
to work in live applications.

Check out these live web demos to see what TorchStream does. No install or login required!
