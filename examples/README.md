# Examples

These are interactive streamlit examples meant as a tutorial for getting started with TorchStream. They cover the basic concepts and go up to streaming a full fledged neural network.

To run these examples yourself, you must install the `demos` requirements i.e.
```bash
uv sync --group demos
```

Then run from the repo root:
```bash
streamlit run examples
```
